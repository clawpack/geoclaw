c     # Apply a limiter to the waves.  
c
c     # Version of December, 2002.
c     # Modified from the original CLAWPACK routine to eliminate calls 
c     # to philim.  Since philim was called for every wave at each cell
c     # interface, this was adding substantial overhead in some cases.
c
c     # The limiter is computed by comparing the 2-norm of each wave with
c     # the projection of the wave from the interface to the left or
c     # right onto the current wave.  For a linear system this would
c     # correspond to comparing the norms of the two waves.  For a 
c     # nonlinear problem the eigenvectors are not colinear and so the 
c     # projection is needed to provide more limiting in the case where the
c     # neighboring wave has large norm but points in a different direction
c     # in phase space.
c
c     # The specific limiter used in each family is determined by the
c     # value of the corresponding element of the array mthlim.
c     # Note that a different limiter may be used in each wave family.
c
c     # dotl and dotr denote the inner product of wave with the wave to
c     # the left or right.  The norm of the projections onto the wave are then
c     # given by dotl/wnorm2 and dotr/wnorm2, where wnorm2 is the 2-norm
c     # of wave.
