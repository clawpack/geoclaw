Often we use `plotitem.plot_var = geoplot.surface_or_depth` which assigns colors based on surface offshore and based on depth of water onshore.

    " - The array is used only when initializing grid patches that have exactly the same resolution as the `force_dry_init` array (and then it is assumed that grid points of this array coincide with cell centers on the patch).  Generally this is used to specify regions that should be forced dry on the finest level.  Coarser grid cells may not be dry in the same regions, but normally the finest grid level is introduced *before* the tsunami arrives so this hopefully does not matter.  (It is problematic trying to initialize coarser grids by e.g. interpolating into the finer `force_dry_init` array since on the coarser grid such a cell might be connected to the ocean by other coarse cells below sea level, and so forcing it to be dry might introduce a discontinuity in water level that leads to huge spurious waves on the coarser grids that pollute the entire computation.)\n",
    " \n",
    " - The ending time `force_dry.tend` is required because at times after the tsunami has come into a region we no longer want to force land to be dry.  The value of `force_dry.tend` should be chosen to be *after* the finest grids have been introduced in the region of interest but *before* the tsunami is expected to arrive.  In setting this, remember that if the finest grid level is required by some flagregion starting at some time `t1`, then that finest level will not actually exist in the computation until the next regridding time at higher levels when this is first seen, so the finer grids do not appear until somewhat later.  In the example used here, the level 4 grid is required in a flagregion that is active starting at 5 minutes, but the results shown above at 5 minutes still only show 3 levels.  For this reason we set `force_dry.tend = 7*60.` below, so `force_dry_init` array is used up to 7 minutes.  "
