Tsunami in a parabolic bowl shaped ocean
========================================

Waves in a parabolic bowl generated by a Gaussian hump of water at the
origin.  The solution should remain circularly symmetric.

In this code, :math:`x` and :math:`y` are in meters (coordinate_system=1 
in `setrun.py`).

Refinement is allowed only in the upper right quadrant, using the regions
specified in `setrun.py`.

Gauges are placed near the shore along the x-axis and along the diagonal.
Ideally these gauges would show identical results.
