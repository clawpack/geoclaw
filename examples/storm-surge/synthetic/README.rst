Basic Example of Storm Surge from Hurricane Ike
===============================================

This example contains the data and setup for running a storm surge simulation
for a square(ish) basin in cartesian coordinates.  The example can be run via::

    make all

This is a good example to use if you are interested in idealized storm surge
as the storm is created in the *setrun.py* rather than downloaded.
